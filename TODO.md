# TODO

Markdown todo file for a project.

## Important

- [ ] Do we need to use ML or just filtering and doing some \*\*\* on images?
    (I think we can't solve this wtih filtering because our dataset has a **LOT OF NOISE** like clouds etc.)

## In progress

- [ ] Look for api on Sentinels site
    - [ ] Download data
    - [ ] Mark segments on them
- [ ] Choose model of finding fields
- [ ] Choose metric Pixel Accuracy, Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index (IOU)
